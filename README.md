# Basic Recipe Exercise

This is for a test basic recipe website meant to strengthen my understanding of HTML, Git, and GitHub. 
By the end of this simple project, I will have put of all these things together and they will lay the
foundation for more complicated and fun things I can get to do in the future. Onwards!
